README FILE

To run our program:
1.)download and unzip it
2.)open a terminal session and cd into the directory of the project
3,) copy and paste the following into a terminal session:

javac Driver.java
java Driver

The expected output will be an introductory note which instructs the user to begin viewing outputs by pressing enter.  In order to view all outputs for all examples implemented, continue to press enter until the program terminates itself.

EXTRA CREDIT:

Our project implement the Liars and Truth Tellers examples from the project guidelines as well as the Advanced Liars and Truth tellers example. These are given as three of the outputs for the file discussed above. The reason it is three outputs for two additional examples is that the original "Liars and Truth Tellers" question is broken into parts A and B, and so our code is as well.
